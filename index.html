          <h3>QUARTZ WATCHES</h3>
           <p>When a watch says “Quartz," it means that the watch is powered by a movement which regulates time through the use of a crystal made out of the mineral quartz. Quartz watches still have gears to turn the hour, minute, and second hands (unless the watch does not have hands, i.e. digital watches), as well as any other complications (explained later), but gears in a quartz watch are turned by an electric stepping motor (a motor that can move a prescribed distance each time it is engaged) that is powered by a battery. </p>

          <h3>MEN'S LOAFERS</h3>
            <p>A Norwegian shoemaker used it as an inspiration for the Aurland moccasin. American companies in the 1930's started calling them loafers, with G.H. Bass adding a strip of leather across the top with the diamond-shaped cutout typical of penny loafers and calling them Weejuns. The Wildsmith Loafer was made by Wildsmith Shoes of London for King George VI as a country house shoe. The design was mimicked by others and sold as the Harrow. Gucci took it up a notch and added a metal strap to the top in the 1960s.</p>
